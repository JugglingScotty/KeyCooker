Create a search engine that filters the results
from a search engine based on custom criteria and reordering
the results.

Original Project walkthrough: https://github.com/dataquestio/project-walkthroughs/blob/master/search/README.md

The engine will get results from the Google API, store them, then 
rank them based on filters we define. We'll end up with a basic 
search page and results list.
